        <h1>Christmas!</h1>
        
        <h2>About Christmas</h2>
        <p> Christmas is one of the most celebrated tradtions in the <strong>WORLD!</strong> Christmas is one of my <strong>favorite</strong> holidays, not because I get gifts, but because I  give gifts. Some people do not believe in <em>Santa Claus</em>. He is a very kind man, who gives gifts to every child in the world in honor of the birth of <em>Jesus Christ</em>. We all write a letter to Santa Claus, and he flys around on his sleigh every night. He reads everyones letters on christmas eve, and he picks a couple of things to give a child on their list. A example of a letter is:<em> Dear Santa, this year, I would like a scooter, a tennis racket and a toy dinosaur. Thank you! sincerely, Johnny</em>. That was a very small and poor letter; I advise you to write a longer one if you actually write a letter. </p>
        
        <h3>Traditions</h3>
    
        <p>There are many traditions for christmas. For example, people put up christmas trees. This tradition is very popular around the world. You decorate the christmas tree, you add ribbons, tinsel, what every want to make the christmas tree look the best it can.<br>

    Another Tradition is putting up christmas lights. We do this to show christmas spirit, and basically turn our house into a christmas tree. We put up lights, I suppose you could put ribbon or tinsel.<br>
