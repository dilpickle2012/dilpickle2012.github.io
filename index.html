        <h1>Christmas!</h1>
        
        <h2>About Christmas</h2>
        <p> Christmas is one of the most celebrated tradtions in the <strong>WORLD!</strong> Christmas is one of my <strong>favorite</strong> holidays, not because I get gifts, but because I  give gifts. Some people do not believe in <em>Santa Claus</em>. He is a very kind man, who gives gifts to every child in the world in honor of the birth of <em>Jesus Christ</em>. We all write a letter to Santa Claus, and he flys around on his sleigh every night. He reads everyones letters on christmas eve, and he picks a couple of things to give a child on their list. A example of a letter is:<em> Dear Santa, this year, I would like a scooter, a tennis racket and a toy dinosaur. Thank you! sincerely, Johnny</em>. That was a very small and poor letter; I advise you to write a longer one if you actually write a letter. </p>
